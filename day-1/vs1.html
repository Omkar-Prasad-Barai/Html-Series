    <h1>Computer Memory</h1>
    <p>A computer is an electronic device that takes raw data as input and, processes it, then provides the desired result. It has the potential to execute programmed computations quickly and with great accuracy. Put in another way, the computer receives input such as data and stores it together with instructions in memory (use them when required). The data is then processed and converted into valuable information. After that, it provides the result according to the inputs. Here, input means the unprocessed data that we want the machine to handle and then give us a response, and output refers to the outcome of the machine's processing of the unprocessed data, which may include data analysis, searching, distributing, storing, and more. Consequently, a computer is also referred to as a data processing system.</p>

    <div class="second"> <h2>What is Memory?</h2>
    <p>The computer memory holds the data and instructions needed to process raw data and produce output. It is the same as a human mind, where data, information, and instructions are stored. It is a data storage device or a data storage component where instructions for processing data are kept along with the data that has to be processed. Both the input and the output can be held here.</p>
